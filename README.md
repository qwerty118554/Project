# Overview

This is the skeleton code for Algorithms and Analysis COSC2123/3119 - *Dynamic Programming in Action: The Knapsack-Maze Challenge*. Across multiple tasks in this assignment, you will design and implement algorithms that navigate a maze to collect treasures. You will address both fully observable settings (where treasure
locations are known) and partially observable ones (where treasure locations arenâ€™t unknown),
which requires strategic exploration and value estimation when solving the maze.

[Additional information, as well as the specification, can be found here.](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/141229/assignments/1076865)

## Technical Specification

The main script is *mazeRunner.py*. It is in the same folder as this README, and is run with the command:

```python mazeRunner.py <config_file>```

In order to run the code, you must have a configuration file. The configuration file contains all the parameters that are needed to:
- generate a maze;
- place objects in the maze;
- create a knapsack;
- find the optimal items;
- generate a path through the maze; and
- create a visual output.

An example configuration file is given to you (*sampleConfig.json*). Feel free to make your own configuration files in order to experiment with different mazes, items and knapsacks. Configuration files take the form of:
```
{
    "randSeed": 50, <- seeds the run to produce the same conditions with the same parameters (remove if randomness wanted)
    "rowNum": 10, <- number of rows the maze has
    "colNum": 10, <- number of columns the maze has
    "randomWallRemovalPercent": 15, <- number between 0 and 80 of percentage of walls to remove
    "numItems": 7, <- number of items to be placed in the maze
    "maxWeight": 5, <- maximum weight an item can take
    "maxValue": 5, <- maximum value an item can take
    "knapsackCapacity": 15, <- the maximum weight the knapsack can hold
    "knapsackSolver": "recur", <- the method we are using to find the optimal items for the knapsack
    "entrances": [[3,-1]], <- entrance locations
    "exits": [[-1,3]], <- exit locations
    "pathFinder": "TaskC", <- method we are using to generate a path
    "solverEntranceIndex": 0, <- the index of the entrance we are using
    "visualise": true, <- flag to produce a visualisation (set to false when doing lots of runs)
    "mazeFromFile": false, <- flag for producing a fixed maze from a text file
    "mazeFileName": "sampleMaze01.txt", <- name of the text file we may be using (useless if flag above is false)
    "fileOutput": "sampleConfig" <- name that we save the outputs to
}
```

Because the knapsack solver's are not implemented (see Tasks A and B), your initial visualisation will only create the shortest path from entrance to exit:

After implementation, the optimal items will be highlighted in green, saved in the parameters, and the optimal path will take The Adventurer through these cells:

In order to create your own visualisations, you will need to install matplotlib.

## Testing

For your convenience, we have included a very basic test file. It can be run by entering the testing folder and running:

```python student_tester.py```

The output will tell you if you pass and fail some basic test for Tasks A and B.

**PLEASE NOTE: Passing these tests does NOT mean you will get full marks for Tasks A and B. These are very simple tests to make sure you are on the right track. The automated testing suite is significantly more rigourous.**

## Software Engineering Practices

Part of your mark is formed by following good SE practices. For details on this, please see the FAQ on EdStem.
